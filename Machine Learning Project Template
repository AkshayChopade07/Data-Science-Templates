Machine Learning Project Template: The Right way of implementation

Step 1: Prepare Problem Or Understand the problem statement

            a) Understanding data set

                        -- Load Required libraries

            b) Observe the dataset

Step 2:Summarize Data

        Need to check descriptive statistics

           a)The Distribution

           b) The Central Tendency

            c) The Dispersion

Step 3: Prepare Data

               a) Data Cleaning

                b) Feature Selection

                c) Data Transforms

                d) Split your data into train and test sets.

Step 4: Evaluate Algorithms

                a)Train your model on the training dataset

                b)Evaluation of Model

                c) Spot Check algorithms

                d) Compare Algorithms

Step 5:Improve Accuracy

        a) Algorithm Tuning

        b) Ensembles

        c) Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating)

        d) Boosting

Step 6: Finalize Model

        a)Create a Standalone model on the entire training

        b) Save Model for Later use.
